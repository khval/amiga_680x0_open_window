# amiga_680x0_open_window

This just some test code, as I need to relearn 680x0 assembler programming. hopefully when the code is working it might be helpful to someone else.

Most of Amiga tutorials programming the Amiga in assembler focus on not using the OS, as this are for demos or games that take over the computer, it was a huge advantage to get most out of your games back in 1988, now its mostly hindrance, for USB / Sound cards / Network and other stuff you might like to having running in the background.

So now there is a need to look for solutions that try to undo some of that bad practice, one way is to write good examples of how to code system friendly, in assembler.

Use the code as you like no conditions attached.

# Compiling.

I compile with a cross compiler, so edit the makefile, change command tool so it uses a normal one if your on a Amiga1200/500, make sure the compiler you are using is not too old.
